#### WHY
To allow users to search for some vocabulary and hear the pronunciation of the word. Also, give him a list of some suggestions.

#### WHAT
It is simple web page that acts like a vocabulary dictionary. We added some features like auto completing.

#### HOW
we worked in two pairs. Every pair worked on a piece of code, then explain it to the other pair in order to make sure that everyone understands everything in the code!

This is what we done in steps:</br>
1.  Built the file structure for our project and create repo for our project.
2.  We started to implement the needed functions for our project.
3. We did some tests for our functions.
4. We finished the main goal of our project, which is to create auto-complete for the inserted word.
5. Then, we started some more features. We create new request for wordnik API in order to get the definition of the inserted word, and to get the pronunciation of this word.
6. Finally, we moved to the styling.
